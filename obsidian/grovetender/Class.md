Classes are a way for players to further customize their characters during the game. Class levels are ONLY earned via [[redeems]]. For each level of a class, that classes level percentage increases by 1%. Classes also determine the base [[attacking type]] and [[skill]] of the character.

Each class focuses on a different stat.

STR: Warrior (Phys)
DEF: Knight (Phys)
MAG: Mage (Mag)
RES: ?? (Mag)
SPD: Rouge
DEX: Ranger (Phys)

After reaching level 100 in a class and rebirthing at least once, advance classes can be unlocked. These share two attributes for extra stat allocation

STR/DEF: ? (-> Slow phys wall)
STR/MAG: ? (-> hits lower attribute)
STR/RES: ? (-> Anti mage)
STR/SPD: ? (-> db100c)
STR/DEX: ? (-> Heavy skill activation)

DEF/MAG: ? (-> FE Dark knight?)
